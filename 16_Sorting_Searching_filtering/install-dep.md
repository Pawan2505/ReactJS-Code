To run the above **React project** with search, filter, and sort functionality using `axios` and Bootstrap, you need to install the following dependencies:

---

### âœ… 1. React

You must have a React environment set up (usually using `create-react-app`).

If not already set up:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

---

### âœ… 2. Axios (for API calls)

To fetch data from the API:

```bash
npm install axios
```

---

### âœ… 3. Bootstrap (for styling)

To use Bootstrap classes like `container`, `row`, `form-control`, `table`, etc.:

```bash
npm install bootstrap
```

Then **import Bootstrap CSS** in your `index.js` or `App.js`:

```js
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

---

### âœ… Optional (but helpful):

#### 4. React Dev Tools (Chrome extension)

For inspecting React components.

---

### ðŸ”§ Summary of Commands:

```bash
npm install axios bootstrap
```

Would you like me to give you the folder structure and how to place this component in your app?
